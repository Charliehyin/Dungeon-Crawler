Currently, thinking about a soul-knight style game, where you can shoot at enemies, enemies shoot at you, there are obstacles, and you need to traverse the map and reach the end. 

Aesthetic Goals: 
Challenge, in the sense that it should challenge the player to dodge enemy attacks, and kill enemies as fast as possible. 
If it is easy for the player to die, yet still clear to the player that it is possible to win, then this is a success. 

Discovery, in the sense that the player should be able to discover new things, and find encounter unexpected features/enemies
If new things the player comes across are interesting and unexpected, then this is a success. 
It is good if the player finds themself wondering how a feature works, and can experiment with it. 

Core Loop:
The core gameplay loop here is the player enters a new room, and in the room, enemies spawn and shoot at the player. The player can shoot at enemies, killing them. 
Upon completing a room, the player gets healed, and gains some gold. 
The player can roam around the map, finding new rooms, finding chests that provide upgrades to the player's weapon, or finding merchants that sell upgrades/heals. 
Eventually, the player will find the exit, beating the game. 

The roaming should fulfill the discovery aspect, and the player should be able to experiment with different weapons/upgrades. 
Fighting enemies and having ways to mitigate damage/heal should fulfill the challenge goal.
